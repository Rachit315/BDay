                **Happy Birthday, Ananya aka Magic Towel!**  
                
                Today is all about you — your light, your soul, your everything. There's something about you that words 
                can't quite reach, but I'll try anyway. The way you **taunt me like a pro wrestler** and make me laugh 
                until I snort, the way you make me feel like I'm the only one who matters, the way you make me feel like
                 I'm the only one who can make you laugh😅. 
                
                You don't even realize how I wait for you to be Active on Insta. When I see that green dot beside your 
                DP logo, it’s like stalk mode activated😁. I’m already typing a 10 line essay about my day just to 
                impress you.  
                
                I hope this birthday wraps you in softness — the kind you give to others so freely 
                 I hope you feel seen and celebrated. 
                
                Life is messy, wild, and beautiful — and I'm glad you're here to live it, to shape it,
                 to feel it all . Keep dreaming, keep glowing,
                  and keep being exactly who you are. 
                  <br>
                  your's truly,
                  Rachit aKa Paglu
